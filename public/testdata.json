These explorations represent an early stage in the understanding of cause and effect as infants learn that voluntary muscle movements generate predictable tactile and visual sensations. They also have a role in the emergence of a sense of self, separate from the mother. This is the 1st stage of personality development. Infants come to associate certain sensations through frequent repetition. The proprioceptive feeling of holding up the hand and wiggling the fingers always accompanies the sight of the fingers moving. Such self sensations are consistently linked and reproducible at will.\" (Feigelman S. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. 2016:65-70)"
